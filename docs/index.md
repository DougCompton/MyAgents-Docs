# MyAgents User Guide

Welcome to the **MyAgents User Guide**! This comprehensive documentation will help you create, configure, and deploy powerful AI agents with integrated toolsets.

## What is MyAgents?

MyAgents is a sophisticated AI agent platform that enables you to build specialized AI assistants for specific business workflows and domains. Unlike general-purpose AI, MyAgents allows you to create agents with:

- **Domain expertise** - Specialized knowledge and context
- **Workflow orchestration** - Multi-step process coordination
- **Tool integration** - Access to external systems via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **Configurable behavior** - Runtime customization through settings

## Key Features

### 🤖 Multi-Persona Architecture
Build complex agents with specialized personas that work together to handle sophisticated workflows.

### 🛠️ MCP Tool Integration
Seamlessly integrate external tools and services using the Model Context Protocol standard.

### ⚙️ Dynamic Configuration
Configure agent behavior at runtime using settings and conditional instructions.

### 🔄 Interactive Sessions
Create conversational agents that maintain context across multiple interactions.

### 📊 Production-Ready
Enterprise-grade architecture with DynamoDB storage, comprehensive logging, and error handling.

## Quick Example

Here's a simple agent that helps with grocery shopping:

```json
{
  "id": "grocery-assistant",
  "name": "Grocery Shopping Assistant",
  "description": "Assists customers with grocery shopping and product recommendations",
  "interactive": true,
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "shopping_helper",
      "description": "Helps customers find products",
      "instructions": [
        {
          "content": "You are a friendly grocery shopping assistant. Help customers find products, provide recommendations, and answer questions about ingredients and recipes."
        }
      ],
      "toolsets": ["duckduckgo"]
    }
  ]
}
```
