# Multi-Agent Workflows

Complex workflows using multiple specialized agents working together.

## Overview

**Multi-agent workflows** enable:

- üéØ **Specialization** - Each agent excels at specific tasks
- üîÑ **Collaboration** - Agents delegate work to each other
- üìä **Parallel Processing** - Multiple agents execute concurrently
- üîÅ **Sequential Pipelines** - Ordered processing through stages
- üå≥ **Hierarchical Organization** - Multi-level coordination

## Sub-Agent Discovery

When an LLM agent has `sub_agents` defined, the system **automatically provides** information about available sub-agents in the agent's instructions. This happens through the `<SubAgents />` data tag, which is auto-appended at runtime.

### Automatic Behavior

You don't need to manually add the `<SubAgents />` tag to your instructions. The system automatically:

1. **Detects** when an agent has the `sub_agents` property
2. **Appends** the `<SubAgents />` data tag to the agent's instructions
3. **Expands** the tag at runtime with detailed information about each sub-agent

### What Gets Included

The expanded `<SubAgents />` tag provides:

- **Name** - The sub-agent's identifier
- **Description** - What the sub-agent does
- **Instructions** (preview) - First 200 characters of the sub-agent's instructions

This information helps the coordinator agent understand which sub-agent to delegate to.

### Example

Given this agent definition:

```yaml
agents:
  coordinator:
    name: coordinator
    description: Routes requests to specialists
    instructions:
      - |
        You are a coordinator. Analyze requests and delegate to the appropriate specialist.
    sub_agents:
      - technical_support
      - billing_support

  technical_support:
    name: technical_support
    description: Handles technical issues
    instructions:
      - |
        Diagnose and resolve technical problems.
        Provide step-by-step solutions.

  billing_support:
    name: billing_support
    description: Handles billing inquiries
    instructions:
      - |
        Address billing questions and process refunds.
```

The coordinator agent automatically receives expanded instructions like:

```
You are a coordinator. Analyze requests and delegate to the appropriate specialist.

Available Sub-Agents:
- technical_support: Handles technical issues
  Instructions: Diagnose and resolve technical problems. Provide step-by-step solutions.

- billing_support: Handles billing inquiries
  Instructions: Address billing questions and process refunds.
```

### Manual Override

If you want to customize the sub-agent information, you can manually include `<SubAgents />` in your instructions. The system will detect the existing tag and won't duplicate it.

```yaml
coordinator:
  instructions:
    - |
      You are a coordinator.

      <SubAgents />

      Use the transfer_task tool to delegate work.
  sub_agents:
    - specialist_a
    - specialist_b
```

## Team Patterns

### Hub-and-Spoke

One coordinator routes requests to specialized agents.

**Structure:**
```
      Coordinator
      /    |    \
     /     |     \
  Agent  Agent  Agent
    A      B      C
```

**When to use:**
- Multiple specialist domains
- Clear routing logic
- Independent specialist tasks

**Example:**
```yaml
version: "1"
id: customer-support
name: Customer Support Team
description: Routes support tickets to appropriate specialists
interactive: true
default_agent: coordinator

agents:
  coordinator:
    type: llm
    name: Support Coordinator
    description: Routes tickets based on issue type
    instructions:
      - |
        Analyze the customer's issue and route:
          - Technical problems ‚Üí transfer_task to technical_support
          - Billing questions ‚Üí transfer_task to billing_support
          - Account issues ‚Üí transfer_task to account_support
          
          Provide context when delegating.
    sub_agents:
      - technical_support
      - billing_support
      - account_support
  
  technical_support:
    type: llm
    name: Technical Support Specialist
    description: Handles technical issues
    instructions:
      - |
        Diagnose and resolve technical problems.
          Provide step-by-step solutions with documentation links.
    toolsets:
      - memory-server
  
  billing_support:
    type: llm
    name: Billing Support Specialist
    description: Handles billing inquiries
    instructions:
      - |
        Address billing questions, process refunds, update payment methods.
          Always verify account ownership first.
    toolsets:
      - memory-server
  
  account_support:
    type: llm
    name: Account Support Specialist
    description: Handles account management
    instructions:
      - |
        Assist with passwords, settings, security, and account deletion.
          Security-first approach - verify identity before changes.
    toolsets:
      - memory-server
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Easy to add new specialists
- ‚úÖ Simple routing logic

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coordinator becomes bottleneck
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No direct communication between specialists

### Hub-and-Spoke + Loop

Coordinator routes to specialists, including a refinement loop:

```yaml
version: "1"
id: content-team
name: Content Team
description: Routes content requests with iterative refinement option
interactive: true
default_agent: coordinator

agents:
  coordinator:
    type: llm
    name: Content Coordinator
    description: Routes content requests
    instructions:
      - |
          Route based on request:
          - New content ‚Üí quick_writer
          - Existing content to improve ‚Üí refinement_loop
          - Research needed ‚Üí researcher
    sub_agents:
      - quick_writer

    model: anthropic
  
  researcher:
    type: llm
    name: Researcher
    toolsets:
      - duckduckgo
```

## Workflow Design Best Practices

### Keep It Simple

Start with simple patterns and add complexity only when needed.

**Good - Start simple:**
```yaml
# Single coordinator with specialists
agents:
  coordinator:
    sub_agents:
      - specialist_a
      - specialist_b
```

**Bad - Overly complex:**
```yaml
# Unnecessary hierarchy
agents:
  top_coordinator:
    sub_agents:
      - mid_coordinator_1
        sub_agents:
          - low_coordinator_1
            sub_agents:
              - specialist
```

### Clear Responsibilities

Each agent should have clear, focused responsibility.

**Good:**
```yaml
technical_support:
  description: Handles technical issues and bugs
  
billing_support:
  description: Handles billing and payment questions
```

**Bad:**
```yaml
general_support:
  description: Handles everything
```

### Minimize Delegation Depth

Avoid deep delegation chains.

**Good - 2 levels:**
```
Coordinator ‚Üí Specialist
```

**Acceptable - 3 levels:**
```
Manager ‚Üí Team Lead ‚Üí Specialist
```

**Bad - Too deep:**
```
Executive ‚Üí Manager ‚Üí Lead ‚Üí Coordinator ‚Üí Specialist
```

### Use Appropriate Types

Choose the right agent type for the workflow.

**Parallel for independent tasks:**
```yaml
# Good - Independent analysis
multi_analyst:
  type: parallel
  sub_agents:
    - technical_analyst
    - business_analyst
    - user_analyst
```

**Sequential for dependent stages:**
```yaml
# Good - Each stage needs previous output
pipeline:
  type: sequence
  sub_agents:
    - stage_1_collector
    - stage_2_processor
    - stage_3_formatter
```

**Loop for refinement:**
```yaml
# Good - Iterative improvement
refiner:
  type: loop
  max_iterations: 3
  sub_agents:
    - content_improver
```

## Common Patterns

### Content Creation Factory

```yaml
# Parallel research ‚Üí Sequential creation ‚Üí Loop refinement
researcher (parallel)
  ‚Üí writer (sequence)
    ‚Üí refiner (loop)
```

### Customer Service Router

```yaml
# Hub-and-spoke with specialized agents
coordinator
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ technical_support
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ billing_support
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ account_support
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

```yaml
# Sequential stages
collector ‚Üí validator ‚Üí analyzer ‚Üí reporter
```

### Multi-Perspective Analyzer

```yaml
# Parallel analysis
analyzer (parallel)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ perspective_1
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ perspective_2
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ perspective_3
```

## Debugging Multi-Agent Workflows

### Trace Execution Flow

Use clear logging in instructions:

```yaml
coordinator:
  instructions:
    - |
        [COORDINATOR] Analyzing request type...
        [COORDINATOR] Routing to technical_support
        
technical_support:
  instructions:
    - |
        [TECHNICAL_SUPPORT] Received request from coordinator
        [TECHNICAL_SUPPORT] Processing technical issue...
```

### Test Individual Agents

Test each agent independently before integration:

```yaml
# Test agent in isolation
test_technical_support:
  # Same as technical_support but standalone
  # Test with sample inputs
```

### Validate Delegation Logic

Ensure routing logic is clear and correct:

```yaml
coordinator:
  instructions:
    - |
          Routing logic:
          - "error" OR "bug" ‚Üí technical_support
          - "payment" OR "invoice" OR "refund" ‚Üí billing_support
          - "password" OR "login" OR "account" ‚Üí account_support
          
          Log routing decision for debugging.
```

## Performance Considerations

### Execution Time

| Pattern | Time Complexity | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| Hub-and-Spoke | 2√ó (coordinator + specialist) | Simple routing overhead |
| Hierarchical | 3-4√ó (multiple levels) | Each level adds overhead |
| Parallel | ~1√ó (as slow as slowest) | Concurrent execution |
| Sequential | N√ó (N = stages) | Each stage is sequential |
| Loop | N√ó (N = iterations) | Linear with iterations |

### Cost Optimization

**Parallel processing:**
- Higher total LLM calls
- Lower wall-clock time
- Good for time-sensitive workflows

**Sequential processing:**
- Same total LLM calls as parallel
- Higher wall-clock time
- Good for dependent stages

**Loop refinement:**
- Cost increases with iterations
- Keep iterations to 2-4
- Diminishing returns after that
